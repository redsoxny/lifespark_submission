Hi there! And thank you for your consideration for my application at Lifespark!

I'm going to put comments in my python code, but I wanted to list out some assumptions I made in building this:

1) It was ok for me to rename the CSVs from "Lifespark Technical Evaluation 2.csv" to something that made a bit more intuitive sense to me :-) 

2) I figured you wanted to see me work in "native" python coding rather than in Pandas or just make a refreshable Tableau workbook, even thogh those are likely the solutions I'd immediately go for for some of these questions -- question #1 for example (top 10 members with highest cost) is a classic SQL/Pandas/Tableau question because Tableau would let you quickly swap top 10 by week/month/year/etc.

3) I probably spent more time than I should have trying to determine what "readmittance" meant for question 3. 

4) Pretty much everything I did here was in nested dictionaries. From a data engineering perspective, that seemed like the right way to go - they're pretty easy to put into pandas (for the data science team) or convert to JSON if another team needs them in that format.
